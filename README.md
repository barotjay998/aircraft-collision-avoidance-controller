Aircraft Collision Avoidance Controller, CS 6376-01 Project: Hybrid and Embedded Systems\

Objectives 
In this project we will create a computer-based simulation of an aircraft collision avoidance system using the python programming language. The primary objective of this project is to develop a controller for aircraft that can guide them safely from their starting point to their intended destination while simultaneously preventing any collisions with other aircraft along their flight path. 
The controller is equipped with the ability to gather information about the current position of the aircraft as well as the location it needs to reach. Additionally, it receives real-time messages from nearby aircraft, which provide crucial data for guiding the aircraft and ensuring they steer clear of any potential collisions with other aircraft. This project focuses on the implementation of a simplified centralized controller, operating in a three-dimensional space, which is responsible for the vital task of preventing aircraft from coming into contact with one another during their respective journeys.
